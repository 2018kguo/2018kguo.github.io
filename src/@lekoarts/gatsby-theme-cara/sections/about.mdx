## About Me 

> Last Updated: 4/9/2022

I'm an ambitious and motivated software engineer, and I'm interested in full-stack development, infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems. 

I'm currently a software engineer at [Ramp](https://www.ramp.com). We're hiring!

Here's my possibly up-to-date [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aL_SNToa_CmD92qWKYF2ouFmAGUMPb2Y/view?usp=sharing).

Some random facts:

- 💸 I recently invested in a vertical monitor and a standing desk setup, which has definitely been worth it
- 🐔 My favorite food is hot chicken (check out Tumble 22 in Austin if you get the chance)
- 🎶 Two of my favorite song artists are Childish Gambino and Gus Dapperton
- 🌃 I like going for walks at night
- 💻 I have a 100% [hackathon](https://devpost.com/2018kguo) win rate (with a tiny sample size 😄)
