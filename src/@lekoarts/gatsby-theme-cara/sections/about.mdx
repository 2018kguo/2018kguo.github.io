## About Me 

I'm an ambitious and motivated software engineer, and I'm interested in full-stack development, infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems. 
I'm currently a senior attending UT Austin.

Starting in June, I'll interning on the DevOps team at [Schonfeld](https://www.schonfeld.com), a new type of role for me that I hope to learn a lot from.
This fall, I'm headed to [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com) as a software engineering intern, where I'll have the opportunity to work on making
self-driving trucks a reality. Next spring, I'll be at [Ramp](https://www.ramp.com) as a software engineering intern and I'm excited to join a rapidly 
growing fintech company disrupting the B2B payments space.

Some things I hope to learn and get a chance to use in the near future include Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, Elixir, and gRPC.

Here's my possibly up-to-date [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uZlGf4Tl3DWlOxgmBUoBpRxEzbyVNGF/view?usp=sharing).

Some random facts:

●🐔 My favorite food is hot chicken (check out Tumble 22 in Austin if you get the chance)

●🎶 Two of my favorite song artists are Childish Gambino and Gus Dapperton

●🌃 I like going for walks at night

●💻 I have a 100% [hackathon](https://devpost.com/2018kguo) win rate (with a tiny sample size 😄)
