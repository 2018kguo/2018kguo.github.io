## About Me 

I'm an ambitious and motivated software engineer, and I'm interested in full-stack development, infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems.
I'm currently a junior attending UT Austin and doing part-time work @ Other World Computing on the backend services team, and plan to take the Fall semester off to intern 
@ TuSimple.
