## About Me 

> Last Updated: 8/13/2021

I'm an ambitious and motivated software engineer, and I'm interested in full-stack development, infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems. 
I'm currently a senior attending UT Austin.

I'm currently a software engineering intern at [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com), working on making self-driving trucks a reality. 
I recently finished interning on the DevOps team at [Schonfeld](https://www.schonfeld.com), where I learned a lot and got the chance to do hands on work with AWS and Kubernetes.
Next spring, I'll be at [Ramp](https://www.ramp.com) as a software engineering intern and I'm excited to join a rapidly growing fintech company that helps businesses save time and spend less.

Some things I plan to learn and use or am in the process of doing so include:

- Go
- Kafka
- Elixir
- gRPC
- ~~Kubernetes~~

Here's my possibly up-to-date [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/143k5lOkJWYFIYQwijQ3l4kxjPgUtd9w_/view?usp=sharing).

Some random facts:

- 🐔 My favorite food is hot chicken (check out Tumble 22 in Austin if you get the chance)
- 🎶 Two of my favorite song artists are Childish Gambino and Gus Dapperton
- 🌃 I like going for walks at night
- 💻 I have a 100% [hackathon](https://devpost.com/2018kguo) win rate (with a tiny sample size 😄)
