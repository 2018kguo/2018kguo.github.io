## About Me 

I'm an ambitious and motivated software engineer, and I'm interested in full-stack development, infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems.
I'm currently a junior attending UT Austin and doing part-time work @ Other World Computing on the backend services team, and plan to take the Fall semester off to intern 
@ TuSimple. Some things I hope to learn in the near future include Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, and gRPC.

Here's my possibly up-to-date [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16kB5R5Y-AP3veHuDmTPJOVmT-O7l_qGy/view?usp=sharing).

Some random facts:

●🐔 My favorite food is hot chicken (check out Tumble 22 in Austin if you get the chance)

●🎶 Two of my favorite song artists are Childish Gambino and Gus Dapperton

●🌃 I like going for walks at night

●💻 I have a 100% [hackathon](https://devpost.com/2018kguo) win rate (with a tiny sample size 😄)
